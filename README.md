# Finlands-Land-temperature-analysis
From the global land temperature dataset I took finland's specially the city Tampere's land temperature data from 1900 to present to visualize and find some key insights as I live in this city right now. Here I plotted the temperature variation, how average temperature is shifting and average months temperature in Tampere. I also pointed out hottest cities in the world and coldest cities in the world by plotting into a chart. We can see from the plot that majority of hottest city are from India and most of the coldest city is from Russia.
